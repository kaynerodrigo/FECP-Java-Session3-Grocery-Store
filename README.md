### Test Coverage Includes:

- Add Product (valid, zero, overwrite)
- Check Product (exists, does not exist)
- Update Stock (exists, does not exist)
- Remove Product (exists, does not exist)
- View Inventory (empty, not empty)
- Inventory isolation (`clearInventory`, `getInventory` returns copy)

- ### Final Notes
All unit tests follow the lab's required scenarios and best practices.  
Console-related logic in `main()` was excluded as per unit testing principles.
